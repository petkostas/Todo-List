This is the file with the guidelines for the Todo Sample project.

### What is the Todo Sample Project

-   Django + Django Rest Framework + AngularJS sample project
-   Version 1.0.0

### Setup

Youâ€™re encouraged to setup a virtualenv to work in prior to configuring the dependencies.

If you are not familiar how to, please follow the link: http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html

1.  Install Project dependencies:
```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Install Node on the system (https://nodejs.org/download/)
3. Install Node dependencies:

```
npm install
```

4. Install Bower:

```
npm install bower
```

5. Install Gulp:

```
npm install gulp
```

6. Install Bower dependencies:

```
bower install
```

7. Install TSD:

```
npm install tsd
```

8. Install Typescript definitions:

```
tsd reinstall
```

9. Build the assets

```
gulp build
```

10. Edit Django configuration file:

```
/todo/todolist/todolist/settings.py
```

11. Run the migrations:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

12. Collect static files (for production):


```
python manage.py collectstatic
```

13. Run the Django tests (optional):

If you are deploying for a production like system, you will find some sample configuration files in the release_support directory of the project.

In order to run as a test app, you can always use the internal testserver of Django (*not for production*):

```
python manage.py runserver <ipaddress>:<port>
```
